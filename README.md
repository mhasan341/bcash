# bcash

This app consist of two screen only (developed within 24 hours and less than 12hrs of work)

# At a glance

* The App followed MVC pattern as much as I understand. 
* The Login screen is made entirely using ProgrammaticUI. 
* Used default resources entirely and No Third Party Library
* Open for adding tests in future although TDD is best.


## LoginViewController
* No Auth
* ProgrammaticUI + UI logics
* Locale Support

## MainViewController
* Network call with pagination 
* Lazy loading

#### Please Note
* Comments were used where necessary and due to limited time whole codebase isn't covered.

* This repo isn't made using TDD due to short time but Tests could be added later.

* I've taken course on ProgrammaticUI from https://seanallen.teachable.com/courses/681906 ,
2 Files from that course used in this source as I lost my own version in Timemachine.
