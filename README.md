# bcash

This app consist of two screen only (developed within 24 hours and less than 12hrs of work)

The App followed MVC pattern as much as possible. 
The Login Screen is made entirely using ProgrammaticUI. 

## LoginViewController
* No Auth
* ProgrammaticUI + UI logics

## MainViewController
* Network call with pagination and lazy loading

#### Please Note
* Comments were used where necessary and due to limited time whole codebase isn't covered.

* This repo isn't made using TDD due to short time but Tests could be added later.

* I've taken course on ProgrammaticUI from https://seanallen.teachable.com/courses/681906
2 Files from that course used in this source as I lost my own version in Timemachine.
